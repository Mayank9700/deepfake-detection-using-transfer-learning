# deepfake-detection-using-transfer-learning
With the rapid evolution of digital media in today's society, something called "deepfake" technology is causing a big problem. Deepfakes are fake videos or sounds that look and sound real. They make it hard to know if what you see and hear is true. 

This study examines how pre-trained Keras models perform in detecting deepfake faces. We compare the performance of VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNet, InceptionV3, and DenseNet169 models using both feature extraction and fine-tuning approaches. Our analysis focuses on accuracy, validation accuracy, and potential trade-offs between model complexity and efficiency.
